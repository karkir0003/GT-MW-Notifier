## Configurations
We will be adding any configuration values and API keys in `config.ini` file.

Copy `config.example.ini` to a new file `config.ini` if using for the first time.
Simple run the following command:
    `cp config.example.ini config.ini`

After creating this new file, there may be missing API keys. Contact the admins to get the API keys.

If you are adding any new values to your `config.ini` file, make sure to add it to `config.example.ini` as well and commit those changes so other developer can add those new config keys. However, do not save the API keys in `config.example.ini` file. Instead put a placeholder for the API keys.
